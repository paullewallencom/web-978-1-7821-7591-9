Bodie, now a California State Park, was a big mining town with a population of around 10,000 in 1880. In the winter time, it competes with Truckee for the coldest place in California. It is a very interesting place to visit and, of course, to take pictures. The Boone Store, closed over 70 years ago looks like it did just last night. The 13 mile road from US 395 to Bodie (paved except for the last  three miles) is situated between Bridgeport and Lee Vining.The picture on your left is that of, believe it or not, a hotel. Ever since I went there, it looked like if it was about to fall down. No, there are no vacancies.</div>
