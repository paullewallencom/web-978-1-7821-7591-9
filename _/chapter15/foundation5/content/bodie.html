<h3>Bodie</h3>
<p>
Bodie is a ghost town turned into a State Park. Once it was a highly populated mining town. Then and today it is often the hottest spot in the state of California in the summer and the coldest in the winter </p>
<p> The town closed down for business in 1937 but today it looks like this happened only yesterday. With its great light, blue skies and well conserved buildings, it is a paradise for photographers.</p>
