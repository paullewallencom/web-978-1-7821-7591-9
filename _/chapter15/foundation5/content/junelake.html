<h3>June Lake</h3>
<p>
June Lake is my favorite place on this planet, and I have not been to any other planet so far. It is located just south of the intersection of SR120, the road coming down from Tioga Pass, the east entrance of Yosemite National Park, and US395, in Lee Vining. </p>
<p>The June Lake Loop, or SR168, is a beautiful road that follows four lakes, Grant, Silver, Gull and, of course, June Lake. It has beautiful fall colors and a great view at Carson Peak all year round. The center of town is in between Gull and June and features lodging, restaurants and the world famous Tiger Bar.</p>
<p> People come there to flyfish, I go there to hange out with my friends and photograph, and in the wintertime they open up June Mountain so people can go ski. It used to be a vacation spot for Hollywood stars, Bing Crosby and Bob Hope made one of their movies there, and in the modern days I occasionally run into someone famous. As for the people that live there, I like to cal every single one of them my friend </p>
