<h3>Lee Vining</h3>
<p>
Lee Vining is probably the place in California that many people visit and never remember they did.It is sitting at the bottom of the Tioga Road, that people take coming down Tioga Pass when they leave Yosemite on the eastside. Every year, many people will remember Lee Vining as the name of the town they could not get to, as they were suprised that they could not get over Tioga Pass, because it was still closed due to snow. This can be the case as late as the first week of July </p>
