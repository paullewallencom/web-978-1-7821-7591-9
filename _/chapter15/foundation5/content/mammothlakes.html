<h3>Mammoth Lakes</h3>
<p>
Mammoth Lakes, with the near 12,000ft. Mammoth Mountain is probably the largest ski area of California. Angelinos can literally go to the beach in the morning and ski in Mammoth in the afternoon, taking the beautiful drive along the eastside of the Sierra Nevada Mountain range on US 395 </p>
<p> Mammoth has a lot of other things to offer, besides skiing. As the name suggests, there are plenty of lakes in the area you can go to to camp and then hike to the ones at higher elevations</p>
<p> You can take a trip to nearby Devils Postpile, a must see freak of nature, and Rainbow Falls</p>
<p> In the summer time it is a paradise for mountain bikers and all year long it is by far, together with the town of Bishop, 50 miles to the south, the only city along US395</p>
