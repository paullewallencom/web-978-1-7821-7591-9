<h3>Mono Lake</h3>
<p>
Mono Lake is a very interseting place. No, that would be an understatement. It is a very unusual place, a very unique place. It used to be a very large lake. I have seen a photograph taken by Ansel Adams at the permanent exhibit in the Visitor Centor in Lee Vining and it used to look like a huge boring lake</p>
<p> Nowadays, it looks like a moonscape. Strange things are sticking out of the lake and they are called tufas. Those crystalline structures built up on the bottom. As soon as the Los Angeles Department of Water built the L.A. Acquaduct to prive the city with water, the lake level dropped dramatically and the tufas became visible</p>
