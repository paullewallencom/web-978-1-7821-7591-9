<h3>Tioga Pass</h3>
<p>
Tioga Pass is where the east entrance of Yosemite National Park is. At almost 10,000ft. elevation that road can be closed until as late as the beginning of July. This has taken many tourists by surprise.
Thos same tourists, if they make it over the pass, often have a destination to go to on the same day, so they do not have time to stop or stay to see any of the beauty the area has to offer. </p>
