<p> Welcome to Mono County, the heart of the Eastern Sierra. Mono County is located along US395 in between Bishop and Lake Tahoe. It has famous Yosemite National Park on the westside and the state of Nevada on the east. It is a paradise for hikers and flyfishers.</p>

              <h3>Tioga Pass</h3>
              <p>
              At over 9,900 ft., Tioga Pass is one of the highest crossings on a State Route in the country. It also marks the eastern entrance (or exit) of Yosemite National Park. During the few months a year you can actually drive to it, it is a marvelous place for hiking and photography. Tioga Pass opened one year on May 21st, July 2nd some other year.</p>

              <h3>Lee Vining</h3>
              <p>
              Lee Vining might possibly be the one town in California that millions of people visit without an intention to do so. It is the first town you reach coming out of Yosemite National Park. Unprepared travellers will often look in vain for lodging.It's main attraction is nearby Mono Lake and its best kept secret is the Mobil Station. It is the best place to eat. Try the lobster tacquitos or the steak sandwich

              <h3>Mono Lake</h3>
              <p>
              The most unusual views in the Eastern Sierra you get to see as soon as you come down Tioga Pass towards  Vining. Right before the junction with US 395 is a vista point overlooking Mono Lake. The water of most of the inlets of this lake go into the L.A. aqueduct. As a result the water level of this very alkaline lake is a lot lower than before, exposing the crystalline structures that developed below the lake surface, called tufas. Five miles south and then five miles east on SR 120 is the South Tufa area, the best spot for viewing and photography.    </p>

              <h3>Bodie</h3>
              <p>
              Bodie, now a California State Park, was a big mining town with a population of around 10,000 in 1880. In the winter time, it competes with Truckee for the coldest place in California. It is a very interesting place to visit and, of course, to take pictures. The Boone Store, closed over 70 years ago looks like it did just last night. The 13 mile road from US 395 to Bodie (paved except for the last  three miles) is situated between Bridgeport and Lee Vining.The picture on your left is that of, believe it or not, a hotel. Ever since I went there, it looked like if it was about to fall down. No, there are no vacancies.

              <h3>Mammoth Lakes</h3>
              <p>Mammoth Lakes is one of the most popular ski resorts of California. In the summer time Mammoth Mountain transforms into a mountain biker paradise. The nearby Rainbow Falls and, freak of nature, Devil's Postpile are two must visits
